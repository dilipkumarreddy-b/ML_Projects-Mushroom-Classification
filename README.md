# ML_Projects-Mushroom-Classification
In this project, we're going to build up a supervised learning model based on “mushroom classification dataset” from UCI Machine Learning repository. Then make evaluation on this model to see is it effectively classifies whether the mushrooms are “edible” or “poisonous”, that means this would be a binary classification problem.
